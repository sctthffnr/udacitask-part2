This project took me around 4 hours to complete. While I have been learning Ruby, I have been trying to learn best practices
for coding. I discovered the gem rubocop and also discovered that the Atom IDE has lint support for rubocop. This has helped
me adhere to community best practices, so I no longer spend time wondering whether an expression that I wrote is considered
to be in the ruby style.

The gem of my choice that I used was terminal-table. I like my output to be in a nice, clear tabular format. I also included
another gem, highline, to add some interactive features to the app.

I added features to change the priority and due date for a todo item. I combined these with the highline app so that users
would have to explicitly enter how they wanted the priority and due date to change. This is missing some error handling, but
it works as long as the input is right. I also added a feature to delete more than one item at a time.

Now that I feel comfortable with OOP principles and with the language in general, I would like to learn more about the standard
ruby library. I am sure that I am creating code that could be more succinctly expressed with a built-in ruby construct.
